# onramp-research
Onramp repo for research tools and interactive data visualizations

The current site can be found on 
https://research.onrampinvest.com

The plan is to create a more extensive library of tools and resources similar to those found in our 
Onramp Advisor's Guide to the Cryptocurrency Markets

Important to note that this code for the "quilt" or grid.js and crypto.js was somewhat "hacked" together by old interns.  We will be refactoring the code to make it more readable going forward.  

Many of the tools from the https://www.realitysharesadvisors.com/tools/dividend-dashboard/ will be refactored and modified to the crypto markets.  The code for those tools is available. Ask Eric.
