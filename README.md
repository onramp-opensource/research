# onramp-opensource-research

This is an open source project for research tools and interactive data visualizations.

The current site can be found at https://research.onrampinvest.com.

Important: this is an experimental project. Collaborators are welcome!

The goal is to create a more extensive library of tools and resources similar to those found in our 
Onramp Advisor's Guide to the Cryptocurrency Markets. This is available at https://blockforce.docsend.com/view/vdppdpwknfsxuj9e.

In addition, many of the tools available at https://www.realitysharesadvisors.com/tools/dividend-dashboard/ can be modified for crypto markets and incorporated as well.

onramp-opensource-research.sql contains a mysqldump of the current database.
